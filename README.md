# Python-Projects

The first project is called **"number guesser"**. The idea behind this project is to generate a random number, and we're going to track how many times it takes the user to guess this number. <br>
The second project is a **quiz game**. The idea behind the game is that we ask the user a series of questions and if he gives us the right answer, he willreceive 1 point for each correct answer. After the user has answered all questions, he will be able to find out what his score is.
